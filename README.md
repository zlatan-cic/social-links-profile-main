### What I learned

I learned the importance of using proper features like max-width and min-width in CSS media queries to ensure responsive design functions correctly. I discovered how CSS specificity and inheritance can affect styling, particularly with hover effects on nested elements, and how to precisely target nested links for color changes on hover. I improved my understanding of ensuring styles are mobile-friendly by correctly setting the viewport meta tag. Lastly, I gained insights into troubleshooting hover behaviors to achieve desired visual feedback in interactive web elements.
